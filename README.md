# Get Started

The product contains three code bases, a Registry contract to maintain stealth meta addresses, and client to generate and interact with the stealth address. The relayer code base is still in progress. Also you may take a look at a crypto utility file inspired from [Umbra](https://www.umbra.cash/) to generate and handle stealth addresses.
